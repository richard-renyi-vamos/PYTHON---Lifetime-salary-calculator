To create a Python app that calculates the lifetime salary based on yearly income and allows for career/income changes, we can use an object-oriented approach. The app will take the yearly salary and the number of years worked at that salary. Additionally, you can input multiple stages of your career, accounting for changes in salary.

Here's an example of how the app might look:

python
Copy code
class CareerStage:
    def __init__(self, yearly_income, years):
        self.yearly_income = yearly_income
        self.years = years

    def calculate_stage_income(self):
        return self.yearly_income * self.years


class Career:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stages = []

    def add_stage(self, yearly_income, years):
        new_stage = CareerStage(yearly_income, years)
        self.stages.append(new_stage)

    def calculate_lifetime_salary(self):
        total_income = 0
        for stage in self.stages:
            total_income += stage.calculate_stage_income()
        return total_income


def main():
    career = Career()

    print("Lifetime Salary Calculator")

    while True:
        try:
            yearly_income = float(input("Enter yearly income for this stage (HUF): "))
            years = int(input("Enter number of years at this income: "))
            career.add_stage(yearly_income, years)

            add_another = input("Do you want to add another stage? (yes/no): ").lower()
            if add_another != 'yes':
                break
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input, please try again.")

    total_income = career.calculate_lifetime_salary()
    print(f"Your total lifetime salary is: {total_income:.2f} HUF")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
Explanation:
CareerStage Class: Represents a stage in your career with a specific yearly income and number of years.
Career Class: Manages multiple stages of your career and calculates the total lifetime salary.
Main Function: Interacts with the user, allowing them to enter different stages of their career and calculate the total income.
How It Works:
The user enters their yearly salary and the number of years they worked at that salary.
They can continue to add new stages (to simulate income changes over their career).
The app calculates the total lifetime salary based on all career stages.
